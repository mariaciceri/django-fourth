# TakeCare Inventory Management

[TakeCare Inventory Management](https://takecare-inventory-187635d57664.herokuapp.com/) is a web application designed for healthcare professionals to efficiently manage stock levels and request products. Users can easily filter items to find what they need and view their selected products in a cart on the same page, making order management more intuitive. For managers, the admin panel provides important alerts when items are low in stock, close to expiration, or when new users need approval, ensuring smooth inventory oversight.

- User Access
    - Users must log in to access the platform.
    - New users require approval; upon registration, a request is sent to the admin panel for manager approval.
- Ordering Process
    - Approved users can search for items, filter them by category, add them to an order list, and submit requests.
    - Orders require approval; while pending, users can modify them.
- Manager Role
    - Managers can approve or reject orders but cannot modify them.
    - They are responsible for updating item categories, stock quantities, expiration dates, and marking critical products.


## UX Design

The page is designed for healthcare professionals, including nurses, doctors, and administrative/warehouse staff responsible for managing medical supplies. It is particularly useful for clinics, hospitals, and care facilities that need an efficient way to track stock levels, place orders, and ensure essential items are always available. Managers benefit from automated alerts for low stock and expiring products, reducing the risk of shortages. While the system is optimized for desktop use in clinical settings, its responsive design ensures that users can access it seamlessly from mobile devices when needed.

### Color and Design Choices

+ The color scheme of TakeCare Inventory Management is primarily composed of shades of blue and gray, carefully chosen to align with the healthcare industryâ€™s aesthetic. Blue is often associated with trust, professionalism, and calmness. Gray complements this by adding a sense of neutrality and balance, ensuring the interface remains clean and easy to navigate without unnecessary distractions. Together, these colors create a professional and reassuring atmosphere for users managing critical inventory tasks.
+ The images used throughout the platform follow the same blue and gray tones to maintain visual consistency and reinforce the theme of reliability. However, the hero image on the general home page features touches of yellow and red to introduce a sense of energy and urgency. This contrast helps capture attention and conveys the importance of efficient inventory management, encouraging users to engage with the system proactively.

### Wireframe

+ The initial wireframes for this project were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/):
+ Changes were made throughout the project delevolpment to improve UX and make the navigation more intuitive.

## Features

### Home page
- If the user is unauthenticated:
    - They can login or register by clicking on the links in the navbar.
- If the user is authenticated:
    - They can start requesting, view past order or logout by clicking on the links in the navbar.

### Admin panel
- When an admin logs in, an alert message is displayed if there are expired or near-expiry items, low-stock items, or pending user approvals.
- When approving multiple orders at once, if stock is insufficient for all, older orders will be approved first, while newer ones will stay pending. An alert message will indicate which orders couldn't be fulfilled due to low stock.
- Manager can not add items without expiration date and the expiration date must be in the future.
- When an order is approved, the items are subtracted from the stock.

### User page
- Approved users can filter items by category.
- Users cannot add a quantity greater than the available stock; a message will display the available amount.
- Users can edit item quantities in their session, up to the maximum available:
    - If the entered quantity exceeds stock, it is automatically adjusted to the maximum.
    - If the quantity is less than 1, the item is removed from the list.
- If the same item is added again via the form, the quantity updates. If the total exceeds available stock, the item is not added.
- When the order is submitted, the home page is cleaned and the user can start a new request. If they leave an unsent order, the items in the order won't be lost if the page is closed/reloaded.
- In the orders page, the users can see their past orders, items ordered, and statuses and modify the order if it is still pending.

## Deployment

+ To deploy both locally and to an external app, you must first: 
    + Clone the repository from GitHub page by running the command `git clone https://github.com/mariaciceri/takecare_inventory.git`;
    + Alternatively, download it as a ZIP file from `https://github.com/mariaciceri/takecare_inventory` and extract it to a chosen location in your computer;
    + To install the necessary libraries, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    + Run the command `python manage.py migrate` to create the tables in the database before using the program.
    + Create a `env.py` file and at the top `import os`.
    + In the env.py create three variables using `os.environ.setdefault()`:
        + `SECRET_KEY` - and give it a value equivalent to a strong password.
        + `DEVELOPMENT` - and give the value of `"True"`.
        + `DATABASE_URL` - and provide a link to a database of choice.
    + Save the project on your own GitHub account by using the command `git push`.
    + To be able to use the admin panel, run `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` and follow the instructions, then use the credentials to access the admin panel and add items and categories to the databases.

### Deployment to Heroku

+ Create a new Heroku app by clicking on "New" and then "Create new app" on their page;
![Heroku menu with new app creating menu](/docs/images/heroku-new-app.png)
+ In the Deploy tab, look for "Deployment method" and select GitHub;
![Heroku menu with deploy selected](/docs/images/heroku-deploy.png)
+ Connect to your GitHub account if not done already and right below it, find your repository and connect to Heroku;
![Heroku Deployment method and App connected to GitHub](/docs/images/heroku-github.png)
+ Give your app a unique name and set the region accordingly. Click create app.
+ In the Settings tab, set one Config Vars:
    + DATABASE_URL(key): -your own database of choice-(value)
    + SECRET_KEY (key): -choose an unique and strong password-(value)
![Heroku config vars](/docs/images/heroku-config-vars.png)
+ In the Deploy tab, scroll down to Manual Deploy, confirm that you are deploying from "main" and click on "Deploy Branch";
![Heroku Manual deploy](/docs/images/heroku-manual-deploy.png)
+ Alternatively, enable "Enable Automatic Deploys";
![Heroku Automatic deploy](/docs/images/heroku-automatic-deploy.png)
+ It may take a couple of minutes to deploy, after completed, a "View" button will be available and it will take you to the deployed page.

### Run locally

+ On the terminal, navigate to the folder where the project is located in your computer and run `python3 manage.py runserver`

## Testing
